# Worms

Worms is a derivative of the following videos by javidx9:

- [Code-It-Yourself! Worms Part #1 (C++)](https://youtu.be/EHlaJvQpW3U)
- [Programming Perlin-like Noise (C++)](https://youtu.be/6-0UaeJBumA)

It's been used to help me develop an understanding of:

- Cameras.
- Perlin noise generation.

To run:

```commandline
cargo run --example worms
```
